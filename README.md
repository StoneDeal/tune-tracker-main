<h2>Tune Tracker</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The goal of my project is to help users find new music to listen to.
The user will provide examples of bands they like. They will then be provided with recommendations for similar bands they might also enjoy. There will be a basic browsing page where
the user can independently find bands. The user will be able to update
their list of band interests, and the website will continue to use this information to find new bands for them.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>User Login: Users will have to create an account and login to use the site.

Browse Music: Users are able to browse bands, adding artists they like to their profile.

Recommended: Based on the user's list of interests, this page will display recommendations for them.</p>
